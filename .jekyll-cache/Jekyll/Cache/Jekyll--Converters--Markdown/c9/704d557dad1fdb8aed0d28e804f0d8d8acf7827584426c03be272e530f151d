<p>We want to able to control the available of a managed host that is imported from dynamic inventory script.  Default behavior only allow disabling manually created host.  Host imported with dynamic inventory is always enabled.</p>

<p>To change this behavior:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a .py file under /etc/tower/conf.d  For example, hostvar-enabler.py</li>
  <li>Insert into the file the following:
   SCM_ENABLED_VAR = â€˜isenabledâ€™
   SCM_ENABLED_VALUE = â€˜trueâ€™</li>
  <li>Restart Tower host</li>
</ol>

<p>Now whenever a host is imported with variable â€˜isenabledâ€™: â€˜trueâ€™ or without â€˜isenabledâ€™, it will be imported as enabled.  Anythingelse is set on variable â€˜isenabledâ€™, the host will be imported as disabled.  The variable name and value is arbitrary.</p>
