<p>We would like to use a third part collection, in this case <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">community.efficientip</code>, in our playbooks. The collection is currently in the Automation Hub server and it also requires a Python module, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SOLIDserverRest</code>, which is available via pip.  Since this Python module is no available in the standard execution environment, we will need to create a new EE image using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ansible-builder</code></p>
