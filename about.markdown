Hi.  I am an IT consultant working for [International Integrated Solutions, LTD](https://iistech.com).  Most of my works are done  around Red Hat products, such as Ansible, Satellite and RHEL.  You can see my [LinkedIn profile here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericchong4linux/).  I am going to use this site to share some of the knowledge I learned or Googled :-) from my everyday experience.  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

I am still learning how to build this site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages)
